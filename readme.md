## About the game.

A very simple game similar to a game you would find in 
old arcade machines. Simple concept to go down and reach 
the highest level you can get. Lots of enemies biomes and items
to explore within.

## Inspiration.

- Noita
This game is amazing and was a main inspiration. Its similar to my game where every particle is simulated. This is a cool concept.

- Spelunky
A cave exploration game. Very replayable because it was randomly generated and addictive.


You will find elements from both of these in my game.
